1. Replace all instances of `AssignmentTracker_Client` with the name of
    your project.
1. Move into the new project and `git init`.
1. Add all of the files in your project with the command `git add --all`.
      - **Note: This is the only time you should run this command!**
1. Commit all of your files with the command `git commit`.
      - Your commit title should read `Initial commit`.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Create a new repository on [github.com](https://github.com),
    _not GitHub Enterprise_.
1. Name the new repository with the same name used on Step 3.

## Structure

Developers should store JavaScript files in [`assets/scripts`](assets/scripts).
The "manifest" or entry-point is
[`assets/scripts/index.js`](assets/scripts/index.js). In general, only
application initialization goes in this file. It's normal for developers to
start putting all code in this file, but encourage them to break out different
responsibilities and use the `require` syntax put references where they're
needed.

Developers should set `apiUrls.production` and `apiUrls.development` in
[`config/environment.js`](config/environment.js).  With
`apiUrls` set, developers may rely on `apiUrl` as the base for API
URLs.

Developers should store styles in [`assets/styles`](assets/styles) and load them
from [`assets/styles/index.scss`](assets/styles/index.scss). Bootstrap version 3 is
included in this template.

Developers should use [getFormFields](get-form-fields.md) to retrieve form data
to send to an API.

To deploy a browser-template based SPA, run `grunt deploy`.

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

- `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
- `grunt make-standard`: reformats all your code in the JavaScript Standard Style
- `grunt <server|serve|s>`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
- `grunt test`: runs any automated tests, depends on `grunt build`
- `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
