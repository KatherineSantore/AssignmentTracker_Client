<h1> Assignment Tracker </h1>

The Assignment Tracker was created to help students keep track of assignments as they
work with a tutor or college application coach. Through the app students are able to log in and create, update,
and delete assignments. There is also a special button when a stuent completes an assignment
that will display a blast of confetti.

<h3> User stories: </h3>

<ol> As a user want to check off assignments that I have completed </ol>
<ol> As a user I want to create an assignment </ol>
<ol> As a user I want to update assignments </ol>

<h3> Technologies used: </h3>
on the front end were: HTML,  HTML Canvas, CSS, Javascript, JQuery,
AJAX, Handlebars, and the JQuery library 'confetti.js'.

In planning for this app, I first created the wireframe (below).
Then I set out to create the basic CRUD functionality. Lastly, I created styling and CSS animations such as the spinning
pencil and confetti drop. I used 'confetti.js', a jquery library to implement the confetti.
In future iterations, I would like to make the confetti fall over the assignment
boxes and also have the assignment box show somehow that the user has finished.
