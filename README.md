<h1> Assignment Tracker </h1>

The Assignment Tracker was created to help students keep track of assignments as they
work with a tutor or college application coach. Through the app students are able to log in and create, update,
and delete assignments. There is also a special button when a stuent completes an assignment
that will display a blast of confetti.

In planning for this app, I first created the wireframe (below).
Then I set out to create the basic CRUD functionality. Lastly, I created styling and CSS animations such as the spinning
pencil and confetti drop. I used 'confetti.js', a jquery library to implement the confetti.
In future iterations, I would like to make the confetti fall over the assignment
boxes and also have the assignment box show somehow that the user has finished.
